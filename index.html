                They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is
                ticking. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? You
                really think you can fly that thing? This thing comes fully
                loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power
                windows.

                you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

                Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the
                pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. They're using our own satellites
                against us. And the clock is ticking. Must go faster. What do
                they got in there? King Kong? I gave it a cold? I gave it a
                virus. A computer virus.
